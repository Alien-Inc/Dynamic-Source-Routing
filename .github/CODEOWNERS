# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. 

# When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies Python files, only @sujairamprasathc and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
